## My process
- i started with the html first, adding the images and text.
- next, i aligned the items to the center by setting its display to flex.
- then i set the sizes, aligned the text, and create boxes for buttons.
- i then went to the js file, and created a function for generating random images every time the user makes a choice. 
- Finally, it was time to display the choices and show the results.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google fonts
- Javascript functions and event listeners

### What I learned
I learned the use of flexbox in css to align items and text. In javascript, i learned to get elements and manipulate their values on user input by adding event listeners. i alse learned write and call functions and change values of different attributes.
